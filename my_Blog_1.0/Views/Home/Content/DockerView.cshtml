<h1>WHAT´S DOCKER</h1>
<img src="~/images/Docker.png" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 300px" alt="Docker" class="img-responsive" /><br />
<p>Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Today’s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.</p>
<h2>FREEDOM OF CHOICE</h2>
<p>Get the flexibility to evolve your application portfolio in the way that makes sense for your organization. Start big or start small - Docker works to extend the life of your legacy applications with a platform that is also for new development.</p>
<h2>AGILE OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>Standardize and automate the way you build, manage, and secure applications across departments. Because Docker puts developers and IT operations on the same platform, they can work smarter and faster together.</p>
<h2>INTEGRATED SECURITY</h2>
<p>Get an integrated security framework for delivering safer applications and improving policy automation that maintains performance and doesn’t get in your way.</p>
